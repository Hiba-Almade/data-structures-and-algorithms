## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
* Time complexity: Î¸(n Log(n)) by divides the array into two halves and takes linear time to merge two halves.

* Space: O(n) It needs an additional space for storing the left and right halves of the original array.

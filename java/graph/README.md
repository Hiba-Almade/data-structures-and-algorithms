# Graphs
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Implementing Graph Data structure.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

**Create**
  - Graph class
  - Node class
  - Neighbor class

**Create**
  - addNode(), addEdge() , getNodes(), getNeighbors(), gitSize() methods in the Graph class
## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in your Graph -->

- addNode(T node) : adds a node to the graph (no edges specified yet).
- addEdge(T node1 , T node2 , int weight) : adds an edge between two nodes.
- getNodes() : returns All nodes in a graph.
- getNeighbours(T node) : returns all neighbours of a specific node.
- getSize() : returns the size of the graph.
